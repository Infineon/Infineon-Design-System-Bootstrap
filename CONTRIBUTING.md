# Contributing to the Infineon Design System Bootstrap
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Or anything else...

## We Develop with Github, So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase.

To contribute fork the repo and create your branch from `master`. When developing make sure to follow our guidelines and coding style. Please contact the maintainers if you need to know more.

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](https://github.com/Infineon/Infineon-Design-System-Bootstrap/blob/master/LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github [issues](https://github.com/Infineon/Infineon-Design-System-Bootstrap/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/Infineon/Infineon-Design-System-Bootstrap/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=) - it's that easy!
